### **I am a college student and a self-taught programmer. I believe in doing stuff the elegant way, which usually costs me a lot of time. It's worth the extra work tho.**

* Websites using Front-end frameworks like React.js, Next.js, Ionic (with React)
* Automate stuff using Python and sometimes Bash
* Spend a whole lot of time ricing my Arch installation
* Love Maths and Physics
