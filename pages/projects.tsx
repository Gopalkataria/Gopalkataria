// If the component IS A PAGE VIEW ( wrapped in BootstrapPage ) , the name should end in "Page"
// if component is A PART OF THE PAGE, the name should end in "Component"
// The only exception to the above rule is BootstrapPage component, which ends with
// "Page" but it's not a page view, it is a wrapper for pages in bootstrap
